# Sassy Hello Kitty Python Code Compiler

Welcome to the **Sassy Hello Kitty Python Code Compiler** â€“ a mood-driven Python compiler that only runs your code when **Judge Kitty** feels like it. Judge Kitty is here to add a little drama and a whole lot of attitude to your coding experience. She might execute your code with grace, but most of the time, she's just in a mood and will throw tantrums, offering sarcastic excuses and complaints. 

Itâ€™s a fun, quirky twist on coding where your code might be sent for a "trial" if itâ€™s deemed unworthy. And if Judge Kittyâ€™s not in the mood? Youâ€™ll just be left in the dark with no way to even switch to light mode! ðŸ˜¼

## Features

- **Mood-Driven Execution**: Your code will only run when Judge Kitty feels like it â€“ which is a solid 25% of the time. The rest of the time? Get ready for tantrums, excuses, and sass.
- **Tantrums & Attitude**: If Judge Kitty decides your code isnâ€™t good enough, expect her to throw a tantrum. She might even tell you your code reminds her of her ex. Ouch!
- **No Light Mode for You**: Feeling like switching to light mode? Judge Kitty says "nope" â€“ youâ€™re stuck in the dark.
- **Sassy Feedback**: Each response from Judge Kitty is filled with sarcasm, witty comments, and just enough sass to make you think twice about your coding choices.

## How It Works
